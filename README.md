Real Cybersecurity Data for Anomaly Detection Research


The BPF-extended tracking honeypot (BETH) dataset is introduced as a groundbreaking cybersecurity dataset specifically designed for uncertainty and robustness benchmarking. This dataset was collected using a unique honeypot tracking system, making it highly valuable for developing and evaluating robust machine learning (ML) methods in the field of cybersecurity.

The BETH dataset possesses several distinctive properties that set it apart and make it attractive for the development of robust ML models:

Size and Scope: With over eight million data points, the BETH dataset stands as one of the largest cybersecurity datasets available. Its vast size allows for comprehensive training and validation of ML models.

Modern Host Activity and Attacks: The dataset contains data on modern host activity and real-world attacks, providing a realistic representation of the evolving cybersecurity landscape. This ensures that ML models trained on the BETH dataset are well-equipped to handle contemporary threats.

Full Labeling: Each data point in the BETH dataset is fully labeled, enabling supervised learning approaches for attack detection and classification tasks. The availability of accurate labels facilitates the development of robust ML models.

Structured and Heterogeneous Features: The BETH dataset comprises highly structured yet diverse features. This characteristic enables the exploration and evaluation of ML techniques that can handle complex and varied data representations.

Furthermore, each host in the BETH dataset contains benign activity and, at most, a single attack, which is ideal for behavioral analysis and other research tasks. Additionally, efforts are underway to continue collecting and analyzing further data, including alternative attack vectors, to enhance the richness and diversity of the dataset.

While several existing cybersecurity datasets, such as the KDD Cup 1999 Data, the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset, the ISCX IDS 2012 dataset, and NSL-KDD, have been utilized in ML research, they are limited by their age and data collection methods. In contrast, the BETH dataset captures modern host activity and data collected from cloud services, making it highly relevant for real-world deployments. Moreover, the inclusion of both kernel-process and network logs in BETH provides a holistic view of malicious behavior, setting it apart from other datasets in the field.
